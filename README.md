# Paxos-Simulation
This REPO was created for housing a Paxos simulation. This simulation was built for the course Distributed Processing at the HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. 

Phase 1 of this project is creating a basic Paxos implementation with Proposers and Acceptors, phase 2 will add Learners. Phase 2 also includes a practical application of the simulation using propietary data.
